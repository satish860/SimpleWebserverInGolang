# SimpleWebserverInGolang
First project in golang with the a Basic HTTP Server. In this project I want to create a basic HTTP server which can server the static HTML file. 

I have defined three routes

| Route       | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| /           | Serves Index.html       |
| /hello      | Prints Hello        |
| /form       | Renders the Form and Parses the form on Post |



# Build
Simple run `go build` from the root of the Project

# Run
You need to Build before running. To run the project `go run main.go` . Http Server starts and run on the Port 3000 . You can browse using the following [URL](http:/localhost:3000)
